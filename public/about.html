<h1>Who will I be!</h1>
<p>
  It is Betul Celik Cetin! I am 28 years old. I was born in Istanbul. 
  I have always liked doing physical activities and pushing my body's physical limits.
  I had spent my summer breaks in Nature with camping, scouting and I had played voleyball for 2 years.
  For several years, I have been spending my free time with fitness, nature walks, ancient excursions.
  I am a real nature lover! I would like to see mountains, rivers, and ancient cities.

  My first scouting experience gave me the chance of life in nature when I was just twelve years old. 
  This adventure connected with Scouting and Guiding Federation of Turkey enabled to me see different places in the World. 
  I experienced to camp out for weeks and sometimes months in the highlands and mountains. 
  I had an opportunity to even make and live in igloo which was amazing for me. 
  I also played several sports such as canoe, riding a horse, archery, orienteering, climbing, and night hiking. 
  Scouting thus was the most effective thing for my nature passion although living in nature has some difficulties. 
  It also brought me self-discipline to apply on whole of my life and caused my passion is to observe and understand the Earth. 
  Eventually, it was the reason of my decision to study Earth as a Geophysicist.

  I started to undergraduate academic degree in Geophysical Engineering, Istanbul Technical University. 
  I did my internships in various companies that works on petroleum, geotechnical, construction and engineering geophysics. 
  Thus, I had a chance to learn and practice broad range of geophysical methods. 
  Then, I discovered most exciting part for me in geophysics that is called “noise”. 
  Until the moment I have learned that seismic ambient noise actually provides many useful information, I thought that noise is always unwanted and must be removed or filtered from data. 
  However, it is something very extraordinary that enables us to continuously listen the Earth's voice if we extend the perspective of our way of observing the Earth. 
  Therefore, my bachelor's thesis was structured on the theory of seismic interferometry to locate scatterers using drill-bit noise.  
  I have discovered something very exciting for me while I was learning how to collect and process data to better visualize and interpret the Earth's subsurface.
  This was the passion to analyse what we observe and to continuously learn from our observations.
  This passion lead me to study the theory behind the dynamics of the Earth and I decided on doing my master degree in theoretical geophysics.

  After I graduated as first degree with honors, I started to my Master Degree in Geophysics that is a joint program of Ludwig-Maximilians Universität München and Technische Universität München in Germany. 
  I decided on seismology as my specialization since I have really excited about wave propagation and the information what they can provide about the Earth's interior. 
  Also, computing a mathematical model to approximate a physical system inside the Earth and then obtaining results of what would be the response such a model, is always impressive.    
  In my master thesis, I thus studied to resolve the time dependent, near surface structural heterogeneities using noise correlations of wavefield gradients. 
  Basically, I had been programming Earth's physics based on advanced maths, coding to simulate models to understand the Earth's interior.

  At the end, I was a Geophysicist, exited about coding some algorithms to create artifical models, and understanding dynamics of our beautiful planet.
  During my educational journay, I have realized that there are continuosly recording data available in this modern World from that we can derive valuable information for a specific purpose not only in the Earth sciences. 
  Eventually, this awereness motivates me on developing learning algorithms that helps to better analyse available data and make them meaningful and useful for future.
  I have seen that I should be evolved more in modern technologies to enhance my programming skills, so I started a bootcamp for software developers in 2020.
  This was the starting point of my career.  
  I have been working as software consultant for MS CRM Dynamics and developing algorithms to support better organizing CRM data. 
  In the meantime, me keep on observing nature, travelling around, think on whys and hows of universe, and continuously learning from life outcomes! :)
